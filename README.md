## About this

`Training with react`: I use react-leaflet to implement a map with the location of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The data of the Wonders is obtained from a fake api that I implemented using https://my-json-server.typicode.com/.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
